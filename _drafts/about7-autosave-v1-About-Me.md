When we retired, Barry thought he would learn to ride with me. Thus my odyssey with Icelandic Horses began. As we searched for the perfect trail horse for Barry, I tried 67 Icelandic horses. I traveled all over the United States and to Iceland. We found the perfect guy for Barry. Unfortunately, he never took to riding. He requires brakes and seatbelts…

I bought two more horses in Iceland and began trying to talk my friends into riding with me. I had 4 horses to exercise, after all: my last Arab, Talia, Baltasar, Fani and Styrmir. Five days after I brought Balti home, I won a Trail Trial riding him against 23 other riders. Maaaan, these Icelandics are cool, unflappable, responsive, smooth…

I roped my first neighbor into riding, taught a few more friends to ride, they wanted to BUY MY horses… hmmmm, I went right back to Iceland and found 5 more horses.

All the horses I’ve purchased are horses that I want to own and ride myself. If I own them their entire lives, that will be fine. I have to feed and care for them every day so their personality, temperament and rideability is paramount.

In the last 12 years I have visited Iceland 11 times, traveled to attend Icelandic World Championship competitions in Germany and Holland and tried out for the US Icelandic team. I’ve published articles, formed a club and made many lifelong friends. Welcome to my world!
