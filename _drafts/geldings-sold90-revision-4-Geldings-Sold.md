Sleipnir <span style="color: red;">SOLD</span>, barn name Slippy, is a fabulous show or trail mount. He was evaluated First Prize as a stallion. His father is the famous Andvari fra Ey. He loves to tolt, has great lift and has a smooth rocking horse canter. Slippy likes to jump and loves to lead the ride. He is brave and forward. He would be an ideal move up for someone interested in competing or a fabulous trail horse. Private treaty.

IS 1992155413 Odinn <span style="color: red;">SOLD</span>, 13.2 hand, 15 year old black gelding, call name Odinn, very pretty, big mane, 5 gaited, has been shown successfully by a young rider. Odinn has been ridden in several parades and was most recently ridden in a demo in Del Mar for Night of the Horse. He is your ideal lesson horse. Will trot in a circle with a kid playing Simon says on his back! Odinn is a unique horse, he is a bit sensitive when tied. He requires some time to get to know his owner and to trust them. Then he is an absolute gem. I trail ride with him with my most fearful beginners. He would be an asset to any barn.
