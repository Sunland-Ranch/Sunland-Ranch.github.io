</div>**Orka**

14 years old, 14 hands 5 gaited, smooth tolter, forward and easy to ride. She has very smooth gaits and a lot of speed in her tolt. Orka is very large for an Icelandic mare. Orka is imported from Iceland. Orka has been on my farm for 3 years and used as a lesson horse. Adults and children are riding her on the trail 2-4 times a week. She is calm around dogs, trucks, bicycles, and she calmly crosses water. Orka’s mane is short on one side, but full and past her shoulder on the other side. She has found a new home.

Dearly loved and trail ridden by mother and children alone often. Family circumstances force sale. She was purchased from the Icelandic farm Pingeyrar in Iceland. She has found a new home.
