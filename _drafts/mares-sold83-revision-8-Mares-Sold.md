**IS1994256806 Fjola SOLD** 13.1 hands, silver dapple, 14 years old. I imported and sold her to her first owner. They have had her 9 years. The kids have moved on and she is looking for a new family. Fjola is very sweet and pretty, she is brave and will go out alone. Fjola has lived with Eva for 8 years and we would prefer that they are sold together. Please contact me for pricing information.
