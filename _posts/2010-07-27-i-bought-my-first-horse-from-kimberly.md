About eight years ago, I bought my first horse from Kimberly. That was only the begining of an ongoing relationship that includes training, outings, shows, confidence building, knowledge, and friendship. Kimberly works honestly and diligently to ensure horse and rider are compatible. Four years after buying my gelding Odinn, Kimberly traded a beautiful mare for him to adjust for my changing needs as a rider. Now that is backing your product. It also demonstrates Kimberlyâ€™s geniune desire to achieve the best match between horse and rider.

Thank you Kimberly.  
K.O.  
Eagle, Freyja, Snickers, Odinn
