## **Lessons**

We currently offer private and group lessons. We can instruct you on your horse or you can use lesson horses that we have here. Depending on your riding ability, we have lessons in the arena and on the trails. We work with all age groups.

We also take Icelandic horses in for training.

**Private lessons – Please call for rates.**

**Group lessons – Please call for rates.**

Please call to schedule a time to meet us, our horses and view our facility.

## **Clinics**

We occasionally hold riding clinics with international guest instructors.

For additional information about lessons and future clinics, please contact:
